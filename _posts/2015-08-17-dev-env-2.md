# Part two: A terminal workflow
The command line is *awesome*; I can't think of a more productive and mature tool to do development work. Additionally, these days terminal-based tools are becoming more mainstream with CLIs for front-end package management and build tools. Quickly, it becomes a pain to manage all the different terminal windows that you have open for servers and shells etc.


## Enter `Tmux`
[Tmux](https://tmux.github.io)'s writers refer to it as a **terminal multiplexer** but it's really more like the greatest thing since `array_slice(bread)`. Essentially, tmux is window manager for terminal windows allowing you to split, tab, and navigate them. It also has some cool features like real time pair-programming. I was going to write a more detailed post about tmux, how I use and customize it but [Ham Vocke](http://www.hamvocke.com/) wrote [this](http://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-guide-to-customizing-your-tmux-conf/) great post and even uses parts of my `tmux.conf` so check it out, start using it and see how it can fit your needs!

As always, this `.tmux.conf` file is synced with all of my machines and symlinked from my dotfiles directory to its location at `~/.tmux.conf` so I only have to think about writing it once. You can see my entire config file [here](https://github.com/barbour-em/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.tmux.conf) but Ham does it a lot of justice in his post.
