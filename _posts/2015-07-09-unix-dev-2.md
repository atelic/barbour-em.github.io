# A Terminal workflow



## The solution: Tmux

### Why a terminal multiplexer

### Why tmux

### Configuring tmux

### Forgetting it

## Emacs

### Which text editor you use doesn't matter, how you use it does
A lot of people right and evangalize about vi, vim, emacs, nano, Sublime, Atom, xyz-iMproved, etc and that's great. People have something that works for them. But that doesn't mean it works for you.

* Productivity is more important than your tools
* Pick one, spend the time necessary to learn it, get back to coding
