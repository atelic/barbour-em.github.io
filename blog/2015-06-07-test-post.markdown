# `console.log('Hello World');`

*groan* I know it's a lame title but I'm at a loss for the moment. Content <s>will</s> may improve in the future.

Hello from my very first blog post! The styling of this site is still majorly under construction but I am still trying to get used to Jekyll. As I type, my bio photo isn't even showing up in the left sidebar. 


I have some ideas about what I want this section of the site to be so here is a list of things I could write about here:

* Linux to OSX migration -- I recently did this
	* Difficulties 
	* Advantages
* `Code` stuff that I do 
* My experiences throughout this intership at a open source startup over the summer
* Maybe some travelling stuff or college / UVA things


So there you have it. Hopefully I'll have a post with real content on here soon
